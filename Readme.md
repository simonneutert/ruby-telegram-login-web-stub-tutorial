# Telegram Login Ruby Roda Demo

**please, read the official telegram login article**  
at https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login _(at least skim it!)_

## For those who try it out üëã

Hey there, glad you gave this a spin! As this project tries to give other rubyists a hand to get tgram going, it is quite possible, that things might not be as straightforward, as I think they are. 

So, just in case the code isn't speaking for itself, or docs could be improved. Something's unclear, please, either open an issue or a PR with suggestions we can discuss. In both cases add as much details as possible (without leaking keys/credentials üêû).

## Requirements

You definitely need:
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) (if there's a nicer substitute out there, one that would lower the effort for this project, please let me know üôè)

For running this project locally you need one of the following two:
* Ruby >= 3.0
* Docker

People using Docker see their own paragraph below.

## Run this project

### Telegram Bot Setup

* go, see [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) on telegram
* create/choose your desired bot (you should have a bot already)
* create your bot and set the domain in the settings
  * the domain you copied from ngrok (https://....ngrok.io)
* see what .env.example ships with and create a `.env` (copy of .env.example) edit with your credentials

### Start and keep running an ngrok Development Server

have ngrok installed and start a server by `$ ngrok http -p 5555` and copy the https url you are given

**Remember** you need to set the domain in the bot settings, each time you restart ngrok!

### Run the app

Run it local using (A) Ruby or via (B) Docker.

#### A - Ruby

* clone this repo
* `$ bundle install`
* open another terminal window and run `bundle exec rackup -p 5555`
* open your **browser at the given ngrok https://** (‚ÄºÔ∏è) domain

clap your hands and login with telegram!

#### B - Docker

* `$ docker build . -t ruby-telegram-login`
* `$ docker run -it --rm -p5555:5555 -e TELEGRAMBOTNAME='yourBot' -e TELEGRAMBOTSECRETKEY='123:abc-def' -e 'a-super-long-128-char-string' ruby-telegram-login`
* open your browser at the given ngrok https:// domain

If you messed up a step above, simply build again, then run again, again, again
